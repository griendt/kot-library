    The <a style="background: none" href="{!! route('stats') !!}">stats page</a> has been expanded a bit. It now shows several progress bars. This is intended to motivate myself and other contributors to the website to continue adding content! In addition to this, there have been several stylistic changes to the site to make it prettier and more comfortable to read. This includes a different font, card shadows, and a more narrow navigation panel on the left.
